## Project name 
Digital Cooking Recipe Application
## Description 
The idea of this application is to demonstrate an Android application used for storing cooking recipes digitally and linking related grocery lists. At the time when I was developing this course project, there was less options for this type of applications and because I enjoy cooking, it was simple idea for course project. This is only demo project because it has no actual database and this was done after my first year in Bachelor studies when we had not yet studied database design.

## How to run
This application can be run by following these steps: 
1. Copy this link: https://github.com/aRakkolainen/myMobileApplication_Rakkolainen_Aino.git 
2. Open the android studio, click path File -> New -> Project from Version Control
3. Paste the link from step 1 to the URL part, choose the directory where you want to open the application and then click Clone. 
4. Then run the app with Pixel 3 API 28 emulator or other of your choice. ( I cannot guarantee it works correctly with all other emulators)

## Learning goals
- Learn mobile development within Android Studio and Java
- Learn software development practices
- Demonstrate the final outcomes of learning for the course

## Project status
Meets the requirements of the course project.  It will probably not be developed any further in this repository, possibly developing more advanced version with different technologies and actual database etc but there is many competitive applications already.

# myMobileApplication
This application can be run by following these steps: 
1. Copy this link: https://github.com/aRakkolainen/myMobileApplication.git 
2. Open the android studio, click path File -> New -> Project from Version Control
3. Paste the link from step 1 to the URL part, choose the directory where you want to open the application and then click Clone. 
4. Then run the app with Pixel 3 API 28 emulator or other of your choice. ( I cannot guarantee it works correctly with all other emulators)
